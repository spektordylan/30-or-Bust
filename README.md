# 30-or-Bust
This program is a two-player game of 30 or Bust played in the command line interface.
It simulates dice rolling between two players and visually displays each roll in the console.
In order to win, a player must reach a score of exactly 30,
accumulating points by selecting values from either die or their sum each turn.
This program uses object-oriented programming to alternate between player objects in a while loop,
passing a different object to the rollDice method every loop.
